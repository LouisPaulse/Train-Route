# Train-Route-
Shortest Route between 2 stations. Metro rail map.
All station codes and names is in stations.dat file
Metrorail_tests uses these codes to calculate shortest path between 2 stations.
zone(1).py uses turtle and tkinter to identify stations using the CT_RailMap.gif
station selection can thus be made by clicking on a station. If it fails to identify, the station code can be used instead.
All station locations are stored in stationsLoc
